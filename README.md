# Weather-App
Proof of concept app to display current weather based on current location or city/zip code


### Next steps:
- In the future we may want to change our cache (persistence) layer to something more robust.
- We can add more weather information to the first screen. The API is currently providing information about wind, pressure and rain chance.
- It would be good to display a nice image behind the weather information on the first screen. There's an easy way to check current weather condition based on the weather id provided by the API.
- There's an easy way to add conversion between metric and imperial system that could be toggled in the weather screen.
- We should also be able to get a better zip code search based on certain country codes.
